# WP-Plugin-Pricing-Pages
Six Months of Screenshots of WordPress Plugin Pricing Pages

Welcome to the repo! Over the past six months, I used the tool Stillio.com to compile daily screenshots of the publicly accessible pricing pages for a number of WordPress plugins, allowing us to compare how each one handles pricing, sales and other messaging on these pages.

The results are housed within folders in this repo, and each image is dated. The pages currently included are:

* https://www.gravityforms.com/pricing/
* https://ninjaforms.com/pricing/
* https://rankmath.com/pricing/
* https://wpforms.com/pricing/
* https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/

All the screenshots in this repo are of publicly accessible pages, similar to how the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) works. All trademarks and content contained in each screenshot are property of their respective owners.
